# Sets-and-Cards
This has been deprecated. This is the same as mardymar.github.io, only it uses Angular. This website uses Parse, but Parse has since been discontinued and a new Parse server would need to be configured.

This is a flash card site that stores user-created flash cards into sets. The sets can then be randomly placed, seven at a time, into groups for study. The user can then choose to study any or all of the groups. The random nature of the groups helps with retention since the user does not learn the definition of a word simply by associating it with another word in its set.
